Caviar
======


TODO
----
 * Support for detached zip files.
 * Support for unpacking to a TMP dir instead of RAM (for things like Gtk where
   we depend on C libraries that can't be converted with caviarize).
 * Support for a custom, dead-simple binary format to replace ZIP files (Go's
   Zips don't support writing uncompressed data and TARs don't feel like a good
   fit. The replacement format would be as follows:
   [EXECUTABLE][MAGIC-1][MANIFEST][ASSETS][MANIFEST-LEN][ASSETS-LEN][MAGIC-2]
   So reading it is a simple matter of:
    1. Read and verify MAGIC-2.
    2. Add ASSETS-LEN and MANIFEST-LEN and use them to calculate start offset
       of Caviar container (MAGIC-1 start).
    3. Read and verify MAGIC-1.
    4. Read both MANIFEST and ASSETS.
    5. Store ASSETS.
    6. Process MANIFEST.
   I may optionally consider adding a FLAGS byte somewhere to specify the
   compression algorithm used for MANIFEST and ASSETS. Options will probably be
   DEFLATE, GZIP, and NONE.
   No format versioning or backwards compatibility is needed as it's assumed
   the running version of Caviar will both be producing the asset bundle and
   reading it during runtime. The supported optimization profiles could be:
   FAST     MANIFEST (NONE), ASSETS (NONE)
   TINY     MANIFEST (GZIP), ASSETS (GZIP)
   NORM     MANIFEST (NONE), ASSETS (DEFLATE)
 * Make the manifest use Protocol Buffers instead of Gob.
 * Cross-platform support.
